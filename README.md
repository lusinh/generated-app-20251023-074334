## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine.
- A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up).
- The [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) authenticated with your Cloudflare account.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/growthpad.git
    cd growthpad
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses `bun` as the package manager.
    ```sh
    bun install
    ```

### Running in Development Mode

To start the local development server for both the frontend and the worker, run:

```sh
bun dev
```

This will start the Vite development server for the React application and a local Wrangler server for the Hono API. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

-   `src/`: Contains the frontend React application.
    -   `pages/HomePage.tsx`: The main and only page for the application.
    -   `components/`: Reusable React components.
    -   `lib/`: Utility functions and API client.
-   `worker/`: Contains the backend Cloudflare Worker code.
    -   `index.ts`: The entry point for the worker.
    -   `user-routes.ts`: Defines the API routes using Hono.
    -   `entities.ts`: Defines data models (Entities) for Durable Objects.
-   `shared/`: Contains TypeScript types shared between the frontend and the worker.

## üíª Development

### Frontend

The entire frontend is contained within the `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` file. All sections (Hero, Services, Testimonials, etc.) are components within this single page. Modify this file to make changes to the UI and frontend logic.

### Backend API

The backend is a Hono application running on Cloudflare Workers.

-   **API Routes:** Add or modify API endpoints in `worker/user-routes.ts`.
-   **Data Models:** Define new data structures to be stored in Durable Objects in `worker/entities.ts`. The project uses a custom `IndexedEntity` wrapper for simplified data access.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is configured for easy deployment to Cloudflare Pages.

1.  **Build the project:**
    First, build the frontend application and the worker.
    ```sh
    bun run build
    ```

2.  **Deploy to Cloudflare:**
    Run the deploy command using Wrangler. This will deploy your application to your Cloudflare account.
    ```sh
    bun run deploy
    ```

Alternatively, you can deploy directly from your GitHub repository.
